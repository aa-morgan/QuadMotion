# QuadMotion
Quadcopter -> LeapMotion -> Cinder -> Arduino -> Quadcopter

This project revolves around stabilising a Hubson X4 quadcopter by tracking its 3D position with the two infrared cameras on the LeapMotion controller, using some simple control theory to calculate the required response, and sending this signal to the quadcopter using an Arduino as to keep it in one place.

I was motivated to start this project after I saw the TED talk by Raffaello D'Andrea 'The astounding athletic power of quadcopters'. I encourage the reader to watch this, it's very impressive.

This GitHub repo is my attempt to document my project with the hope of helping anyone involved in something similar, or for them to reproduce what I have done.

If anyone has any questions about this project or related topic then please don't hesitate to contact me on,
